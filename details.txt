First of all great job with the fixes, everything seems to be running smoothly over the last few days.

Few small modifications

one more fix regarding Drushim,
this seems to be only with drushim, it is similar to the last fix with Aljobs
Inline image 1
in some cases the companies don't have a company page, lets add the job page in place of the company page in such cases specifically for the new / removed file.

I also noticed some issue with the scrapes, i took a few companies from JobMaster and compared the number of jobs they have in our excel and it is smaller then the number of the site.

Lets talk about it once your back from your vacation


Once done we I will provide you with the specs for JobNet and we can finish.
